# PHP Guestbook

Simple guestbook app in PHP with MySQL.

The app can be run using the `docker-compose.yml` file included.

If required, install Docker and `docker-compose`, following the instructions at 
https://docs.docker.com/install/ and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ .

Then the command `docker-compose up` in the same folder as `docker-compose.yml`
will create the necessary Docker containers, and the app will be made available
on port 8585, at http://localhost:8585/ .
